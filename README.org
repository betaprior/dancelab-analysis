* DanceLab analysis

This is the code being currently used to analyze the acceleration/gyroscope data
collected by the DanceLab Android app.  The dance-science.org file details
the analysis workflow (assuming concrete data files as input; the data files
aren't provided yet).

Video generation scripts are currently in the quick hack stage, and be
forewarned that cross-correlation does not always correctly align the audio
data.  

Furthermore, it cannot be taken for granted that audio and sensor data start
at the same time. The offset between them can reach a few hundred ms (data
leads audio).  Thus, when collecting data it's currently necessary to
"timestamp" the audio and sensor streams by bumping the phones together.  The
audio/sensor stream offsets can then be found by manually looking at the
peaks in the data.  Note that Audacity is a good tool to examine/manipulate
audio streams.
